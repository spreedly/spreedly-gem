raise "Mock Spreedly already required!" if defined?(Spreedly::MOCK)

=begin rdoc
Provides a convenient wrapper around the http://spreedly.com API.
Instead of mucking around with http you can just Spreedly.configure
and Spreedly::Subscriber.find. Much of the functionality is hung off
of the Spreedly::Subscriber class, and there's also a
Spreedly::SubscriptionPlan class.

One of the goals of this wrapper is to keep your tests fast while
also keeping your app working. It does this by providing a drop-in
replacement for the real Spreedly functionality that skips the
network and gives you a simple (some might call it stupid)
implementation that will work for 90% of your tests. At least we
hope so.

Help us make the mock work better by telling us when it doesn't work
so we can improve it. Thanks!
